## Full Pipeline (6 Phases)

### Phase 1: Transcript Processing
*Runs `/process-transcript` logic*

Extract guest info, flag 15-20 moments, score them, select top moments, classify by content type, check for duplicates.

### Phase 2: Title Development
*Runs `/generate-titles` logic per moment*

For each moment: extract anchor, classify, generate 8 options, verify, flag top 2. Narrow to 2-3 best per moment.

### Phase 3: Description Writing
*Runs `/generate-descriptions` logic*

Shorts descriptions (hook + attribution + link + hashtags) and full episode long-form description.

### Phase 4: Thumbnail Planning
*Runs `/plan-thumbnails` logic*

Two-line text for both podcast and shorts formats per moment.

### Phase 5: Quality Review
*Runs `/review-content` logic*

4-pass review: banned words, voice check, title review, completeness. Fix all blocking issues.

### Phase 6: Package Assembly

Compile into final deliverable.
